'''Argus Panoptes''' (or '''Argos''') is the name of the 100-eyed giant in [[Greek mythology]].

==Mythology==
Argus Panoptes ({{lang|grc|Ἄργος Πανόπτης}}), guardian of the [[:wikt:heifer|heifer]]-[[nymph]] [[Io (mythology)|Io]] and son of [[Arestor]],&lt;ref&gt;Therefore called ''Arestorides'' (Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii.1.3, [[Apollonius Rhodius]] i.112, [[Ovid]] ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' i.624). According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (ii.16.3), Arestor was the consort of [[Mycene]], the [[eponymous]] nymph of nearby [[Mycenae]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a primordial [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] whose [[epithet]], &quot;''[[Panoptes]]''&quot;, &quot;all-seeing&quot;, led to his being described with multiple, often one hundred, eyes. The epithet ''Panoptes'' was applied to the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] of the Sun, [[Helios]], and was taken up as an epithet by [[Zeus]], ''Zeus Panoptes''. &quot;In a way,&quot; [[Walter Burkert]] observes, &quot;the power and order of [[Argos]] the city are embodied in Argos the [[Herder|neatherd]], lord of the herd and lord of the land, whose name itself is the [[Argolid|name of the land]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Homo Necans'' (1972) 1983:166-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Panoptes'', reflecting his mythic role, set by Hera as a very effective watchman of Io, was described in a fragment of a lost poem ''[[Aegimius (poem)|Aigimios]]'', attributed to Hesiod:&lt;ref&gt;Hesiodic ''[[Aegimius|Aigimios]]'', fragment 294, reproduced in Merkelbach and West 1967 and noted in Burkert 1983:167 note 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''And set a watcher upon her, great and strong Argos, who with four eyes looks every way. And the goddess stirred in him unwearying strength: sleep never fell upon his eyes; but he kept sure watch always.''}}

In the 5th century and later, Argus' wakeful alertness was explained for an increasingly literal culture as his having so many eyes that only a few of the eyes would sleep at a time: there were always eyes still awake. In the 2nd century AD [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] noted at Argos, in the temple of Zeus Larissaios, an archaic image of Zeus with a third eye in the center of his forehead, allegedly [[Priam]]'s ''Zeus Herkeios'' purloined from Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 2.24.3. (noted by Burkert 1983:168 note 28).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ovid]], to commemorate her faithful watchman, Hera had the hundred eyes of Argus preserved forever, in a [[peacock]]'s tail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]] I, 625. The [[peacock]] is an Eastern bird, unknown to Greeks before the time of Alexander.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fábula de Mercurio y Argos, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|left|Argus dozes off: [[Velázquez]] renders the theme of stealth and murder in modern dress, 1659 ([[Prado]])]]
Argus was [[Hera]]'s servant. His great service to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] pantheon was to slay the [[chthonic]] [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]-legged monster [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] as she slept in her cave.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' ii.783; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'', 295ff; Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii.i.2).&lt;/ref&gt; Hera's defining task for Argus was to guard the white heifer Io from Zeus, keeping her chained to the sacred olive tree at the [[Argive Heraion]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheke]], 2.6.&lt;/ref&gt; She charged him to &quot;Tether this cow safely to an olive-tree at [[Nemea]]&quot;. Hera knew that the heifer was in reality [[Io (mythology)|Io]], one of the many nymphs Zeus was coupling with to establish a new order. To free Io, Zeus had Argus slain by [[Hermes]]. Hermes, disguised as a shepherd, first put all of Argus's eyes asleep with spoken charms, then slew him by hitting him with a stone, the first stain of bloodshed among the new generation of gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermes]] was tried, exonerated, and earned the epithet ''Argeiphontes'', &quot;killer of Argos&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth makes the closest connection of Argos, the neatherd, with the [[bull (mythology)|bull]]. In the  ''Library'' of pseudo-Apollodorus, &quot;Argos killed the bull that ravaged [[Arcadia]], ''then clothed himself in its skin.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Bibliotheke]], 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacrifice of Argos liberated Io and allowed her to wander the earth, although tormented by a [[gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] sent by Hera.
