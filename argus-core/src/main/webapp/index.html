<h1>Argus</h1>
<h3>If you are seeing this page, then Argus was successfully deployed to this domain. Enjoy!</h3><p>Argus is a high-performance, scalable web service that provides web-page monitoring, triggering notifications when specified keywords were either added or removed from a web document. It supports multi-language parsing and supports reading the most popular web document formats like HTML, JSON, XML, Plain-text and other variations of these.</p>
<p>This service implements a information retrieval system that fetches, indexes and performs queries over web documents on a periodic basis. Difference detection is implemented by comparing occurrences between two snapshots of the same document.</p>
<p>Note that Argus uses the Reactive (Publish/Subscribe) model, where <u><strong>an additional client web service must be implemented to consume Argus web service</strong></u>. This allows for an asynchronous operation, where the client does not have to lock its threads while waiting for page changes notifications nor implement a busy-waiting condition checking of Argus status.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="request-subscribe">Request: Subscribe</h3>
<p>To watch for content changes in a document, a POST call must be sent to ** http://localhost:9000/argus/v1/subscribe ** with the following JSON body:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>{
    &quot;documentUrl&quot;: &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;, // the page to be watched (mandatory field)
    &quot;clientUrl&quot;: &quot;http://your.site/client-rest-api&quot;, // the client web service that will receive detected differences (mandatory field)
    &quot;keywords&quot;: // the keywords to watch for (mandatory field)
    [
        &quot;argus&quot;, // looks for changes with this word (and lexical variants if stemming is enabled)
        &quot;argus panoptes&quot; // looks for changes with this exact phrase (and lexical variants if stemming is enabled)
    ],
    &quot;interval&quot;: 600, // the elapsed duration (in seconds) between page checks (optional field, defaults to 600)
    &quot;ignoreAdded&quot;: false, // if &#39;true&#39;, ignore events where the keyword was added to the page (optional field, defaults to &#39;false&#39;)
    &quot;ignoreRemoved&quot;: false // if &#39;true&#39;, ignore events where the keyword was removed from the page (optional field, defaults to &#39;false&#39;)
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that a subscribe request is uniquely identified by both its document URL and its client URL. This means that a single client can subscribe and receive notifications of multiple documents simultaneously, and a single document can be watched by multiple clients.</p>
<h3 id="request-cancel">Request: Cancel</h3>
<p>To manually cancel a watch job, a POST call must be sent to ** http://localhost:9000/argus/v1/cancel ** with the following JSON body:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>{
    &quot;documentUrl&quot;: &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;, // the page that was being watched (mandatory field)
    &quot;clientUrl&quot;: &quot;http://your.site/client-rest-api&quot; // the client web service (mandatory field)
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="response">Response</h3>
<p>Immediate responses are returned for every subscribe or cancel request, showing if said request was successful or not with the following JSON body:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>{
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;0&quot; // a number that uniquely identifies this error type (0 when the request was successful)
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;&quot; // reason for the error (empty when the request was successful)
}</code></pre>
<p>The error code is useful to convert received responses into custom error messages displayed to the user in the client app. The following list shows all possible error codes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Code</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Message</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The provided document URL is invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">2</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The provided client URL is invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">3</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">You need to provide at least one valid keyword.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">4</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">At least one difference action ('added' or 'removed') must not be ignored.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">5</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The request conflicts with a currently active watch job, since the provided document URL is already being watched and notified to the provided client URL.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">6</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The request has an invalid format.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">7</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The specified job to cancel does not exist.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="notification-ok">Notification: OK</h3>
<p>Notifications are REST requests, sent as POSTs, to the provided client URL at any time. The client URL should be implemented to accept the requests below.</p>
<p>When detected differences are matched with keywords, Argus sends notifications to the provided client URL with the following JSON body:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>{
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;ok&quot;,
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;,
    &quot;diffs&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;action&quot;: &quot;added&quot;,
            &quot;keyword&quot;: &quot;argus&quot;,
            &quot;snippet&quot;: &quot;In the 5th century and later, Argus&#39; wakeful alertness ...&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;action&quot;: &quot;removed&quot;,
            &quot;keyword&quot;: &quot;argus&quot;,
            &quot;snippet&quot;: &quot;... sacrifice of Argus liberated Io and allowed ...&quot;
        }
    ]
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="notification-timeout">Notification: Timeout</h3>
<p>Argus is capable of managing a high number of concurrent watch jobs, and is implemented to save resources and free up database and memory space whenever possible. To this effect, Argus automatically expires jobs when it fails to fetch a web document after 10 consecutive tries. When that happens, the following JSON body is sent:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>{
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;timeout&quot;,
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;,
    &quot;diffs&quot;: []
}</code></pre>
